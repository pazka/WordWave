# WordWave / SONUS MICROFORM : Back End

Backend code for the WordWave project, used for the "SONUS MICROFORM" ArT-Tool designed by Alessia Sanna

## Motivation

The project must have a central point of speech-to-text but a multitude of asynchronous data receivers which will run the visualisation separately.

We thus need a centralized server that will count our words and send the latest visualisation information to the clients
